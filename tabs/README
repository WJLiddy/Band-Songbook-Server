see XML/ for the songs to test.

I chose some well-known punk songs cause they're easy and people in class will know them. Don't worry, I'll find harder stuff soon.

Songs (in order of difficulty to interpret)

Silent Night:
Parts: Two Guitars
Very short, straight-forward piece.

When I Come Around:
Parts: Rhythm Guitar, Lead Guitar, Bass, Drums. 
This should be fairly easy to interpret. Mainly Eighth notes.

All The Small Things:
Parts: Guitar, Bass, Drums, Vocals 1 and 2 
First song to feature vocals. Good test cases would involve reading the vocal line alone as well as showing the vocal and guitar line on screen. My music XML editor did not properly export lyrics, but these couple of songs should keep us busy for now.
